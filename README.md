#### Some cool features

- pseudo-classes
- Documentation and Screencasts: https://tailwindcss.com/screencasts/
- It is very intuitive\* (for me!!): explain that is intuitive for me because I KNOW css beforehand. therefore class names are very familiar.

## Misconceptions about Tailwind

- "you don't have to know CSS to use it"
- "you cannot use a CSS-in-JS lib & Tailwind together"
- "you end up with a lot of unused classes in your app"

## Some Final thoughts
